        About me
      </h2>
        <p>
          I'm a results-driven Web Developer with 5+ years of experience building responsive, user-focused websites and applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. I specialize in turning design mockups into fully functional, high-performance websites that are optimized for usability and accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end development, I bring full-stack capabilities that enable seamless collaboration across teams. I’ve worked on e-commerce platforms, corporate websites, and dynamic single-page applications—always prioritizing clean code, cross-browser compatibility, and mobile responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Passionate about continuous learning, I stay up to date with emerging technologies and best practices in UI/UX and web performance. Whether working independently or on a team, I’m committed to delivering solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also drive user engagement and business results.
